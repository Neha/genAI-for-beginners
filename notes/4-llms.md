## LLMs

LLMs are known as "Large Language Model". LLMs are the data that are pre-trained on a specific tasks.
LLMs are the foundation of the Gen AI. 

### workflow

Input (from user) -> context window -> LLMs -> Output 

**Let's understand the flow:**

a. Input: The initial input provided by the user.

b. Context Window: The segment of the input (and possibly previous inputs) that the LLM will consider. This window has a fixed size, meaning it can only accommodate a certain number of tokens.

c. LLM: The large language model processes the information within the context window.

d. Output: The response generated by the LLM based on the context.

**LLMs:**

1. Use pre-trained LLMs

2. Train your own Models,

3. Use a hybrid approach: Combine Pre-trained , and custom-trained models


### Foundational Models

1. Foundational models are pre-trained models provided by different providers.

2. These models come with APIs, SDKs ready to be used in your project

3. To create an app, use a foundational model's API and start building your app on top of it.


### How to choose foundational Model?

LLMs can be picked on the basis of:

1. usecases

2. Pricing

3. Tokens Limits


### Common foundational models

1. GPT

2. BERT

3. T5

4. Claude

5. Jurassic
