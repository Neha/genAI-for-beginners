## Prompt Engineering

If you are using chatGPT then you already know how to use prompts. However, in this section, prompt engineering is beyond it.

So, it is worth knowing how to improve prompt and get most out of LLMs.

### What is prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is about asking creative questions to LLMs to get most out of the LLMs

Eg: 

user: Can you review this: 

user: Can you create a new employee welcome email

However, we can improve this content by being more specifci and giving more context.

Eg: Be specific what you want to be review - spelling, grammar, sentiment, etc 

Eg: Give the detail about employee, company, and role, and you will see the difference.

takeaway: Be as specific , and clear with your prompt and you will see the difference.

### Type of prompts:

1. Zero shot: zero shot prompts are where the user won't provide any extra information or context

2. Few shot: Where user will share more context and also do supervised training. 

eg: I/p 

o/p

One can re-train the LLMs by wokring with prompts too.

PS: prompts are crucial for any GenAI app. These will also decide the cost of the app too.
