## Prompt Engineering

If you are using chatGPT then you already know how to use prompts. However, in this section, prompt engineering is beyond it.

So, it is worth knowing how to improve prompt and get most out of LLMs.

### What is prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is about asking creative questions to LLMs to get most out of the LLMs.

Let's look into an example:

Example 1: _user_: Can you review this: [ CONTENT ]

Exampple 2: _user_: Can you create a new employee welcome email: [ CONTENT ]

However, we can improve this content by being more specific and giving better context.

Example 1: Be specific what you want to be review - spelling, grammar, sentiment, etc 

Exampple 2: Give the details about employee, company, and role, and you will see a better response from the LLM.

**Takeaway: Be as specific , and clear with your prompt and you will see the difference.**

### Type of prompts:

1. Zero shot: zero shot prompts are where the user won't provide any extra information or context

2. Few shot: Where user will share more context and also do supervised training. 

### Takeaways

One can re-train the LLMs by wokring with prompts. This is a cheap and easier way. Keep feeding the more data, and context
and you will see a huge, and positive improvements.

PS: prompts are crucial for any GenAI app. Prompts will also decide the cost of the app too.
