## Machine learning

Machine learning is the subset of AI. ML focuses on algorithms and statistical models allowing computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Machine Learning approach

1. Drives rules from the data iteself.

2. Machine will adapts itself with the new information 

3. Trains models ahead of the time, 

## Machine learning Fundamentals

### Model

A trained algorithm which is used to identify patterns in data, and does not require explicit, manually set rules.

A model is a program that has been trained on the set of data to recongize certain patterns or make certain decisons
without further human intervention.

### Algorithims

Algorithims are procedures , often described in mathematical language or pseudocode, to be applied  to a dataset to achieve a  certain function or purpose.

AI models use algorithims to recognize the patterns and trends in data.

These are compromise of weights, and features. (read the paper - Attention all you need)

### Example

Lets train someone to learn how to make a coffee:

1. Ingredients -> data  (milk, sugar,  coffee, cream)

2. Coffee Machine -> Tools 

3. Recipe -> Algorithms 

4. training a Barista -> training a model

5. providing feedback -> Optimize your model

6. Barista is ready -> Model is ready 

7. Serving regular customer -> Model using training data 

8. Serving new customer -> Inference

### ML Algorithims

. Supervised Learning (using labeled data)

In this the algorithims are trained on labelled data. The goal is to model to predict the new or unseen input as output. 


. Unsupervisied learning (finding patterns from unlabeled data)

In this the model is provided with unlabeled data and it needs to identify the features, and patterns


. Reinforcement (learning from feedback) 

Learning througb trail and error. It is neither supervised not unsupervised learning as it does not require training, or data set.
It relias on the monitoring the response of the action and provide a reward on correct learning, and penatly on wrong.
