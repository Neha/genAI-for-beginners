## What is GenAI?

Generative AI, also known as "GenAI," is a subset of AI focused on generating content — whether it's text, images, videos, or more—based on prompts provided by users. An example of GenAI is ChatGPT, which can generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

## Use Cases of Generative AI
Generative AI has numerous applications, including:

- Image Generation: Creating realistic or artistic images based on descriptions. Eg: OpenAI DALL·E 3, MidJourney

- Video Generation: Producing videos from scripts or enhancing existing footage. Eg: Runway Gen-2, Pika Labs, Stable Video Diffusion (SV3)

- Summarization: Condensing long emails, documents, or articles into concise summaries.

- Document Creation: Drafting documents or automated responses.

And many more: The potential uses of GenAI are expanding rapidly.
