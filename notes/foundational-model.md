We know that under the hood AI requires the learning of the data. We can train or make the machine learn in the following ways:

1. supervised Learning

2. unsupervised Learning

3. regression  Learning

Without data AI won't work.  Training of data is crucial.


One can have pre trained models known as "Foundational Model" or take the data to train them to specific tasks. Eg: giving a trainee a training on how to make coffee in Barista. We are training the barista for a specific tasks to make coffee of different types. 


## Foundation Model (FM)

Foundation Model are the models which are trained on the specific thing. Eg: text, scientifics, maths, audio, etc. There are pre-trained FMs ready to use are available such as Bedrock from Amazon, Hugging face. etc. You can train your own model. 

Gen AI will use these foundational Model to create the new content.
